Software Design Patterns
Design patterns are used to represent some of the best practices adapted by experienced 
object-oriented software developers. A design pattern systematically names, motivates, and 
explains a general design that addresses a recurring design problem in object-oriented 
systems. It describes the problem, the solution, when to apply the solution, and its
consequences. It also gives implementation hints and examples.

Design Patters | Set 1 ( Introduction )
A design pattern provides a general reusable solution for the common problems occurs in software
design. The patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes and objects. 
The idea is to speed up the development process by providing well tested, proven development/design paradigm. Design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving a common problem. That means a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular 
implementation. By using the design patterns you can make your code more flexible, reusable and 
maintainable.
It's not mandatory to implement design patterns in your project always. Design patterns are not
meant for project development. Design patterns are meant for common problem solving. Whenever
there is a need, you have to implement a suitable pattern to avoid such problems in future.
To find out which pattern to use. You just have to try to understand the design patterns and it's
purposes. Only by then you will be able to pick the right one.

Goal:
Understand the purpose and usage of each design patterns. So, you will be able to pick and 
implement the correct pattern as needed.

Example:
For example, in many real-world situations, we want to create only one instance of a class.
